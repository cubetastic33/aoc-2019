# aoc-2019
My solutions for Advent of Code 2019, written in rust

To run the solutions, you need to specify your AoC session ID. You can put it in
an `aoc_helper.toml` file or use any of the other methods specified in
[`aoc-helper`](https://github.com/cubetastic33/aoc-helper)'s docs. Then, you can
just do `cargo run` or `cargo run --release`.
